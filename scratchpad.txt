Like tmuxinator.
Sample project to practice ruby/rspec/cucumber.

= Todo =

  - How do write a cucumber test to check 'window title' is saved without actually causing 'tmux list-windows' to be called? i.e  can we temporarily override what TmuxExecutor.window-title does? Is is appropriate?

= Features =

== Save ==

 - Save to text file
 - Save window title
   - Auto window titles should not be saved, as tmux infers them from the current command
   - Save all window titles
 - Save window number
 - Save panes
    - Save pane position
    - Save pane content
        - Currently running command
            - All running commands/background jobs
            - Special case for vim using viminfo/vim sessions?
        - Terminal history
        - Command history

== List saved sessions ==

 - List sessions from text files
 - Full content
 - Summarise content

== Restore ==

 - Restore from text file
 - Pick a saved session and reproduce it
