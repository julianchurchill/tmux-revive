Like tmuxinator.
Sample project to practice ruby/rspec/cucumber.

= Todo =

 - 'Single window restore' story should include creating a new tmux session

 - Consider expanding existing cucumber stories to include arbitrary properties such as window size and position of panes in a scenario outline
   - Possibly try a couple of seperate properties stories before rationalizing

= Features =

 - Save to text file, persistent store
 - Save all window titles
    - Restore all window titles in the order they were saved
 - Auto window titles should not be saved, as tmux infers them from the current command
 - Save window number
 - Save panes
    - Save pane position
    - Save pane content
        - Currently running command
            - All running commands/background jobs
            - Special case for vim using viminfo/vim sessions?
        - Terminal history
        - Command history

 - List sessions from text files
 - list full session content
 - Summarise session content

 - Restore from text file
 - Pick a saved session and reproduce it
