Like tmuxinator.
Sample project to practice ruby/rspec/cucumber.

= To do =

 - Expand existing cucumber stories to include arbitrary properties such as window size and position of panes in a scenario outline
   - Possibly try a couple of seperate properties stories before rationalizing

= To improve =

 - restore only creates a detached session - would be better to attach as well but Cucumber tests don't work when using a real attach (get a 'not a terminal' error), although this does work ok in normal use.

= Features =

 - Save all window titles
    - Restore all window titles in the order they were saved
 - Auto window titles should not be saved, as tmux infers them from the current command
 - Save window number
 - Save panes
    - Save pane position
    - Save pane content
        - Currently running command
            - All running commands/background jobs
            - Special case for vim using viminfo/vim sessions?
        - Terminal history
        - Command history
